DAY 1: 


What is React ?

- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is the view layer for web applications.


What is Component ?

1. A component is a self contained module that renders some output.

2. Independent peices of functionality.

3. Describe a part of the UI app

4. May containe a locally scoped 'state' obj.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Stateless Component (Function based component) or Presentational Components :-

1. These are simple JavaScript functions that accept props (short for "properties") and
   
 return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

2. They are also known as "stateless" or "dumb" components because 
  
they don't manage their own state or have access to lifecycle methods.


import React from 'react';

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

export default Welcome;


---------------------------------------------

The StatefulComponent (Class Components) or Container Components :-

1. These are JavaScript ES6 classes that extend from React.Component. 

2.They are also called "stateful" or "smart" components because they can manage their own state and have access to lifecycle methods.

3. The component re-renders based on the changes to its state and may pass down propeties of it's state to child components as properties on a props object.


import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Welcome extends Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}

export default Welcome;

What does mounting mean ?

Since we are defining virtual representation of nodes in our DOM tree with react, we are not actually defining DOM nodes.
Instead we are building up in-memory view that React maintains and manages for us.

When we talk about mounting, we're talking about the process of converting the virtual components into actual DOM elemnts that
are placed in the DOM by react.
